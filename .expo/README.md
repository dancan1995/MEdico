# Geo Calculator App

This is my simple React Native application that calculates the **distance (in kilometers)** and **bearing (in degrees)** between two geographic coordinates.

---

## Features

- Input start and end geo-coordinates (latitude and longitude)
- Compute distance in kilometers
- Compute bearing in degrees
- Input validation with real-time error messages (e.g., "Must be a number")
- Clear button to reset all fields and dismiss keyboard
- Touch outside to dismiss keyboard
- Built using **React Native**, **Expo**, and **React Native Elements**
